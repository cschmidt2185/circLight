# circLight

circLight is a custom-built alarm clock system that integrates hardware (PCB boards, microcontrollers, and dimmable lighting modules) with software (embedded firmware and scheduling logic) to simulate natural sunrise and sunset cycles.  

The goal is to create a standalone, open-source device that helps regulate the human circadian rhythm by gradually adjusting light intensity, acting as both an alarm clock and a wellness tool.
